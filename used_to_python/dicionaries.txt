dicitionaries are pretty similer to java script objects 


key --- value 



my_dic = {
"name" : "potato",
"age" : "immortal",
}
duplication is not allowed in the dicationary 


my_dic = {
	"name" : "potato",
	"name" : "shasha",
}
the name key will now point to shasha if you try to print it 

my_dic["name"]

you can use the len functions on the dicationary 

len(my_dic)
and you can mix in data types
my_dic{
	"name" : "ez",
	"age" : 18,
	"awake" : false,
	"list" : ["yea","no"],
}

dont forget the "," after each data 

type(my_dic)  --  dictionary
