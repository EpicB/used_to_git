Lists in python is an array but has its own functions i would say


name = ["hello","yes","no"]

indexed based variables with multiple values accessed from 0 to the len -1

to access no 


name[2]

you can use slice

name[start:end]

defualt start is 0
defualt end is (length of list)

negative indexing is allowed 

name[-1] // will provide the last item in the list
returns "no"

name[0:-1] print everything beside the last element idk why

using the list constructor

list(("hello",0,False))

Lists methods

List1.extend(list2) this method will join the 2 lists together

list1.append("potato") this method will add the desired value to the end 
			of the list
list1.insert(index,"potato") this method will add the desired value to 
				the desired index of that list

list1.remove("potato") this method will a remove the desired value

list1.clear() removes every item in the list

list1.index("potato") this will print the index number of the desired 
			value
list1.count("potato") how many times was potato repeated in the list

list1.sort() sorts the list of numbers

list1.reverse() returns the list in reverse 

list1.copy() returns a copy of the list

list1.pop() removes the last value in the list

list1.pop(1) removes the value that has the index of 1 

del list1[0] deletes the first item of the list

del list1 << completely removes a list becomes undefined
