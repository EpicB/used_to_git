to read from a file in python 

the method open

nameoffile = open("filelocation","operation")

operations on files are as follows

r read from the file

w wrtie from the file

a append to the file

r+ which means read and write to the file


nameoffile =open("FileLocation","operation")
between those is how we interact with the file

nameoffile.readline() #gets the first line
nameoffile.readline() #gets the 2nd line since it was called twice
nameoffile.readlines() #returns all the lines of that file as a list 

nameoffile.close()


you can loop over all the the files 

such as

for lines in nameoffile.readlines():
	do the following


when it comes to writing to a file first the operation should be w 

such as follows 


files = open("filename.txt","w") #this will write to the file
files.write("this is a new line") 
files.close

if you want to append just change the 'w' operation to 'a'

this will writeline a list each one is seperated with a new line
lines = ['line1', 'line2']
with open('filename.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.writelines("%s\n" % l for l in lines)
