in python you can create classes such as 

the 'pass' keyword
allows you to bypass the error in the code for a certain code block

class myclass: 
	x = 5


c1 = myclass()

print(c1.x) >> returns a 5 


now in each there a function called the init function
which gets called when a functions gets intialized

def __init__(self,name,age):
	this.name = name
	this.age = age

myclass("potato",65) 


you can del attributes from objects 

such as 


del c1.age

if you want to delete the whole class 

del c1

c1 is now undefined
