you can use the try except syntax to deal with errors that occur


try:
	something
except: if any exception occur (general) 
	soemthing happens to make for the error

try:

except valueerror: if a valueerror occurs then do the following
	soemthing happens

there are multple erros that occur but if you wanna generalize the errorsjust type except on its own

you can add an else after the except which means if the try happened 
correctly therefor tell me that or do something about it

try:
	something
except: 
	do soemthing else in case of error
else:
	if the try worked i wanna be excuted
