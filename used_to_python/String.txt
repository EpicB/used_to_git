Strings in python:

name = "potato"

you can print that name

print(name)

you can print each letter by itself

print(name[0]) if the index is higher than the length it will give error

you can print special charcaters

print('hi,\n \'potato') \n new line \' is to allow you to print '


you can use different functions on strings 

name.upper() uppercase everything
name.lower() lowercase everything
name.islower() is it fully lowercase??
name.isupper() is it fully uppercase??

to check the length
len(name)
len("hello") 

to find a particualer charcater index 
name.index("o",2) the 2nd argument is optional and its the start

to replace a certain character with another it replaces all 
name.replace("o","a")

you can chain functions together 
name.lower.islower() >> always true since it converts to lower case first
